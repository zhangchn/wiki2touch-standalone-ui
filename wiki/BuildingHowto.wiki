#summary How to build wikisrvd that runs on Mac OS X or Linux.
#labels Featured

= Introduction =

Wikisrvd, the core component of wiki2touch, is a mini web server with the capability to decompress, parse the MediaWiki XML dump and rewrite into an HTML.

Besides running on a jailbroken iPhone/iPad/iPod touch, wikisrvd could also be useful as a mini server hosting read-only images of MediaWiki sites on various OSes.

= Details =

Building the wikisrvd requires:

 * Clang/LLVM, or GCC with c++ support. (It has been tested to work with Clang 3.0 and g++ 4.6 on Ubuntu 12.04 x86_64)
 * CMake and GNU Make Utility
 * Header files and libraries for libbz2 and libcrypto.

First, check-out source code from branches:
{{{
  svn co https://wiki2touch-standalone-ui.googlecode.com/svn/branches/wikisrvd wikisrvd
}}}
Then, run CMake to generate the Makefile:
{{{
  cd wikisrvd/
  cmake .
}}}
Build:
{{{
  make
}}}
As the building finished, an executable `wikisrvd' would be generated. Copy it into `daemon' directory:
{{{
  cp wikisrvd ./daemon/
}}}
To run the daemon:
{{{
  ./daemon/wikisrvd
}}}
